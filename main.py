HOW TO USE:
Change the parameters above and run the script.

NOTES:
The following far-fetched assumptions have been made to simplify the analysis:
* Both the stock and index have a fixed, evenly-distributed average monthly return. For example, if the average annual return is set to 8%, the monthly return needs to be 0.643% to compound to 8% annually.
* The tax otherwise deducted in the ESPP option is used as an addition to the alternative investment in the index.
* The stock's return is greater or equal to the index's return. why? 
	(a) Simplification. This way, neglecting fees, using a quick-sell upon purchase and reinvesting the profits in an index is worse than or identical to keeping the stock.
	(b) If you don't believe this is the case, you should seriously consider quitting your job ðŸ˜›
